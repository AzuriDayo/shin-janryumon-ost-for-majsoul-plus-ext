# shin-janryumon-ost-for-majsoul-plus-ext
Extension that replaces game audio by Shin Janryumon OSTs for [Majsoul Plus](https://github.com/MajsoulPlus/majsoul-plus)

The script was based on and modified from another extension that randomizes BGMs.  
This extension does not work fully. Audio for game2,3,4,6,7,8.mp3 do not work.  
I have no idea why or how to fix that.  

I also want to implement the playback for `game8.mp3` when it is round 4 in an East-only game, instead of `game4.mp3`.

I'm open to contributions.
